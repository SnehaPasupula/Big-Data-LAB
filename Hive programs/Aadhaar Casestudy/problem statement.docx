Use case of analyzing a dataset from Aadhaar - a unique identity issued
to all resident Indians. The issuing authority - UIDAI provides a catalog
of downloadable datasets collected at the national level. our dataset of
interest is &quot;Enrollments processed in detail&quot;.

2. Count the number of Identities generated in each state

Questions of Interest or other Analytics that has to be drawn from the Aadhaar data

1. For how many states the Aadhaar data exists?
2. What is the % of Aadhaar&#39;s being approved per state? Are there states where there is a high percentage of rejection?
3. What is the percentage of people applying for Aadhaar per state? Are there some states where the percentage of people applying for
Aadhaar are low? (This would need census information per state) For the states with high rate of rejection can we narrow down to a
district or an agency?
4. What is the distribution of Aadhar cards per age?
